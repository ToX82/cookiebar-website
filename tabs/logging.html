        <h5>Logging user choices</h5>
        <p>
        In some countries it is necessary to keep a record of the user's choices regarding cookies.<br>
        CookieBAR is a frontend-only tool, and for now it doesn't provide this functionality, but it's easy to get the result of a user's choice and save the record in your own database.<br><br>

        When a user sets a preference, a cookie is in fact recorded, called `cookiebar`, which can contain one of these values:<br>

        <ul class='list'>
        <li><span class='keyword'>CookieAllowed</span> (the user has chosen to accept all cookies),</li>
        <li><span class='keyword'>CookieDisallowed</span> (the user has chosen to refuse all cookies),</li>
        <li><span class='keyword'>CookieCustomized</span> (the user has chosen to accept only certain types of cookies).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        In the event that the user has chosen to customize cookies, it will be possible to find one or two additional cookies:
        <ul class='list'>
        <li><span class='keyword'>cookiebar-tracking</span> (the user has accepted the tracking cookies),</li>
        <li><span class='keyword'>cookiebar-third-party</span> (the user has accepted third-party cookies).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        With this information you should be able to create your own function for saving user choices, without relying on external services.
